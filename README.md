# AI Teacher (Next.js + PDF Parsing)

This is a **Next.js application** that analyzes PDFs using the [`pdf-parse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse) library.  
It was originally using a test PDF (`05-versions-space.pdf`) bundled inside `node_modules/pdf-parse/test/data/`,  
but those files are **not guaranteed to exist in production builds**.  

To fix this, we now keep PDFs inside our own `public/` folder.
